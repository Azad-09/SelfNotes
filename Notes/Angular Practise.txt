Angular Concepts:--

Data Binding:--

1. String Interpolation :- Binding Bussiness property from .ts file to the HTML template. Not only that we can also interpolate any Words or Sentences within the 2 Curly Braces i.e {{helloWorld()}}.

2. Property Binding:- Here we put the property of HTML template inside a square braces and in the right side we write the property name.
<button btn btn-info [disabled] = 'status'</button>
status = true;

3. Event:- Here the event by the user can be captured by putting the event inside a parenthesis and use it with bussiness function like 
<button (click)= 'onClick()'></button>

4.($event):- (input) = 'onUpdate($event)' == this will type all the input that user type inside the input bar or the text space. this event work as to get the instatnt event typed by the user.

5.Two-Way-Binding:- In this we combine both Property & Event Binding [(ngModel)] = "serverName"....
Here in two way we can change the data from both from Template as well as the
from .ts file and it will work both way.. 

6. Use '--skip-tests' instead of '--skipTests'. = It is used to skip the test case in an component.
